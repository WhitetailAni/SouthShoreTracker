# PaceTracker
A simple Swift interface library for the South Shore Line's tracker API. Mostly designed for use with [Cerulean](https://github.com/WhitetailAni/Cerulean).

No API key is needed as while their API *does* require a key to work... the key "TESTING" works and that's what the website uses.

All endpoints were found by looking at network requests made by their [tracker website](https://southshore.etaspot.net//)

Please don't spam their API too much!

No idea how low this framework will support, please experiment
